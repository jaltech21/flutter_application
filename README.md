# flutter_application
This file has 2 branches the main branch and the old-working-version branch.
The main branch had a gradle error so I had to create a new branch to revert backwards and solve the error.
To do a pull request:
use git pull origin old-working-version
After pulling the application do:
flutter clean
flutter pub get and then,
flutter run to run the application.
